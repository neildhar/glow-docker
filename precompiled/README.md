# Glow Docker image (precompiled)
This image is **huge** and only serves the limited use case where you want to download everything pre-compiled and run the examples. Changes are not persistent.
## Running container

Run container using
```docker run -it neildhar/glow:precompiled```

This will open a shell to access the container. The container contains both the debug and release builds, as well as the examples. You can immediately run the examples.
